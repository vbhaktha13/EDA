What if you think about the quality of wine, how can you differentiate the wine according to their quality? The big question arises.
According to experts, the wine is differentiated according to its smell, flavor, body and color, but we are not a wine expert to say that wine is good or bad. What will we do then?
Hereâ€™s the use of Machine Learning comes, yes you are thinking to write we are using EDA and machine learning to check wine quality. 

Lets look at our variables in Red wine

- volatile acidity :   Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.
- fixed acidity :   Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic
- residual sugar :   Amount of sugar left after fermentation.
- citric acid :    It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.
- chlorides :   Amount of salt present in wine.
- free sulfur dioxide :   So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.
- total sulfur dioxide 
- pH :   In wine pH is used for checking acidity
density 
- sulphates :    Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.
- alcohol :   Percent of alcohol present in wine.

Simple approach and yet, great insights
